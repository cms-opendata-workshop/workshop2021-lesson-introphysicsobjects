     Exercises: 0 min
     Questions
         * What are known as physics object in CMS?
         * What will I need to do in this lesson?

***** Overview *****
The CMS is a giant detector that acts like a camera that “photographs” particle
collisions, allowing us to interpret their nature.
Certainly we cannot directly observe all the particles created in the
collisions because some of them decay very quickly or simply do not interact
with our detector. However, we can infer their presence. If they decay to other
stable particles and interact with the apparatus, they leave signals in the CMS
subdetectors. These signals are used to reconstruct the decay products or infer
their presence; we call these, physics objects. These objects could be
electrons, muons, jets, missing energy, etc.; but also lower level objects like
tracks. For the current releases of open data, we store them in ROOT files
following the EDM data model in AOD format.
In the CERN_Open_Portal(CODP) site one can find a more detailed description of
these physical objects and a list of them corresponding to 2010 and 2011/2012
releases of open data.
***** What is expected in this lesson? *****
In this lesson we will guide you through reading some documentation, which will
give you a better idea about the physics objects in CMS. As you progress with
the next episodes, you will find a set of simple questions that need to be
answered in the corresponding questionary in our assignment_form. The question
numbers in the form match the numbers in this lesson. You can edit this form at
any time.
     ***** Key Points *****
         * Basic information about physics objects in CMS can be found in
           the Cern Open Data portal site. A set of questions need to be
           answered in our assignment_form.
===============================================================================
****** The CMS detector ******
     ***** Overview *****
     Teaching: 20 min
     Exercises: 0 min
     Questions
         * What are the main components of the CMS detector?
     Objectives
         * Learn the very basic principles of CMS subdetectors and the
           technologies they use for sensing particles.
***** Subdetectors and their technologies *****
Physics objects are built with the information collected from the sensors of
the CMS detector. Take a look at the CMS experiment in the image below. In this
video you will get a quick feeling of how it looked back in 2018, the last year
of data taking in Run 2.

Please read this short description of the CMS experiment and answer the
questions below in our assignment_form. Do not be afraid of exploring the
details of each subdetector in the dedicated links that appear therein. They
are very short.
Question #1: What is the heaviest component of the CMS Experiment?
Question #2: Where can muon tracks be measured in the CMS detector?
Question #3: According to this CMS detector summary, around how many crystals
can be found in the barrel section of the ECAL subdetector?
     ***** Key Points *****
         * The CMS detector is a complex machine with multiple subsystems
           and technologies dedicated to identify/build physics objects.
===============================================================================
****** Egamma objects ******
     ***** Overview *****
     Teaching: 15 min
     Exercises: 0 min
     Questions
         * What are the key aspects in the building of electromagnetic
           physics objects?
     Objectives
         * Learn the basic notion of egamma (electron and photons) object
           reconstruction.
***** Finding electrons and photons with the CMS detector *****
In this recent_article you can learn about the most basic ideas of electrons
and photons reconstruction. It refers mostly to the Run 2 epoch, but worry not
because the essential aspects were also true for Run 1 and the open data from
that epoch. Read this article and answer the following question in our
assignment_form.
This is an example of the many objects reconstructed in CMS. In the next
episode you will dig a bit deeper into the main reconstruction algorithm used
in this experiment.
Question #4: What is known as an electromagnetic shower in CMS?
     ***** Key Points *****
         * Egamma physics objects are built using information from the
           tracking system as well as the ECAL subdetector. It is a vivid
           example of physics objects reconstruction.

****** The Particle Flow algorithm and reconstruction of other objects ******
     ***** Overview *****
     Teaching: 20 min
     Exercises: 0 min
     Questions
         * What is the particle flow algorithm?
         * What are the key aspects to remember about how PF works?
         * How can PF can be used to build physics objects?
     Objectives
         * Learn the basic aspects of the PF algorithm.
         * Get the ide of how physics objects are built using the PF
           algorithm
***** Overview *****
In the last episode, you learned about how electromagnetic objects are
reconstructed using methods like clustering and linking of tracks with ECAL
energy deposits. These actions are essential parts of the so-called Particle
Flow (PF) algorithm.
[../fig/pflow.png]
The particle-flow algorithm aims at reconstructing and identifying all stable
particles in the event, i.e., electrons, muons, photons, charged hadrons and
neutral hadrons, with a thorough combination of all CMS sub-detectors towards
an optimal determination of their direction, energy and type. This list of
individual particles is then used, as if it came from a Monte-Carlo event
generator, to build jets (from which the quark and gluon energies and
directions are inferred), to determine the missing transverse energy (which
gives an estimate of the direction and energy of the neutrinos and other
invisible particles), to reconstruct and identify taus from their decay
products and more.
***** Clustering, blocking and linking *****
To dig deeper into the logic of the main tasks needed in a PF algorithm for
reconstruction, please read these_slides from one of our CMS colleages. Answer
the questions below in our assignment_form.
Question #5: What does the energy of a clustering seed in the calorimeters need
to be?
Question #6: What are blocks?
***** Particles and corrections *****
At this point you must have a pretty good picture of how the different physics
objects (and their final incarnation as particles) are made.
For instance, in the image below, where egamma (electrons and photons) objects
(in red and blue), inner tracks (black) and muon chambers tracks (also called
standalone in green) are depicted, one can infer the possibility (particle
hypothesis) of building global muons.
[../fig/muons.png]
Note that the global muon on the left might not be isolated (there is a lot of
track activity around), while the one on the right does seem to be an isolated
one (of course, muons can also leave energy in the calorimeters). Following a
jet clustering algorithm, the bulk of activity on the left could be identified
as a jet. Most algorithms in CMS use PF objects.
Finally, these physics objects may need corrections. Check out these example
for ECAL cell calibrations needed for all ECAL clusters:
[../fig/clustercalib.png]
As it was mentioned in the beginning, a list of physics object can be found in
this guide from the CODP. There, one can also find extended references.
     ***** Key Points *****
         * The PF algorithm aims at reconstructing and identifying all
           stable particles in the event, which can be later used to build
           other physics objects.
