## Subdetectors and their technologies

Physics objects are built with the information collected from the sensors of the CMS detector.  Take a look at the CMS experiment in the image below. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLHrXmsQ924) you will get a quick feeling of how it looked back in 2018, the last year of data taking in Run 2.

Please read [this](https://cms.cern/detector) short description of the CMS experiment and answer the questions below in our [assignment form](https://forms.gle/sMyuLFiYJWRsUAew6).  Do not be afraid of exploring the details of each subdetector in the dedicated links that appear therein.  They are very short.

**Question #1**:
What is the heaviest component of the CMS Experiment?

**Question #2**:
Where can muon tracks be measured in the CMS detector?

**Question #3**:
According to this CMS detector summary, around how many crystals can be found in the barrel section of the ECAL subdetector?
