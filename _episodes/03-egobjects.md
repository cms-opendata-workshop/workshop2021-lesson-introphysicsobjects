## Finding electrons and photons with the CMS detector

In this [recent article](https://cms.cern/news/finding-electrons-and-photons-cms-detector) you can learn about the most basic ideas of electrons and photons reconstruction.  It refers mostly to the Run 2 epoch, but worry not because the essential aspects were also true for Run 1 and the open data from that epoch.  Read this article and answer the following question in our [assignment form](https://forms.gle/sMyuLFiYJWRsUAew6).

**Question #4**:
What is known as an electromagnetic shower in CMS?

This was an example of the many objects reconstructed in CMS. In the next episode you will dig a bit deeper into the main reconstruction algorithm used in this experiment.
