title: "Egamma and other physics objects"
teaching: 15
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What are the key aspects in the building of electromagnetic (egamma) and some other physics objects?"
objectives:
- Learn the basic notion of egamma (electron and photons) object reconstruction.
- Read a little bit about the reconstruction of other objects
keypoints:
- Egamma physics objects are built using information from the tracking system as well as the ECAL subdetector. It is a vivid example of physics objects reconstruction.

## Finding electrons and photons with the CMS detector

In this [recent article](https://cms.cern/news/finding-electrons-and-photons-cms-detector) you can learn about the most basic ideas of electrons and photons reconstruction.  It refers mostly to the Run 2 epoch, but worry not because the essential aspects were also true for Run 1 and the open data from that epoch.  Read this article and answer the following question in our [assignment form](https://forms.gle/sMyuLFiYJWRsUAew6).

**Question #4**:
What is known as an electromagnetic shower in CMS?

This was an example of the many objects reconstructed in CMS. In the next episode you will dig a bit deeper into the main reconstruction algorithm used in this experiment.

## Other physics objects

To expand your familiarity with physics objects reconstruction, we recommend these short reads on [jets](https://cms.cern/news/jets-cms-and-determination-their-energy-scale) and [muons](https://cms.cern/news/enhancing-muon-compact-muon-solenoid).
